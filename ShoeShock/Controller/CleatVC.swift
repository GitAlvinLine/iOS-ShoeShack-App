        // to organize better and update the views through the updateView() function from there
        // But I couldn't figure out how to reference the IBOutlets to storyboard without
        // crashing and getting a "nil" error. So I tried to make independent files of UILabel class
        // and UIImageView class to connect to the storyboard so that I can reference @IBOutlets
        // but it couldn't connect. I had to connect it through the "UIViewController"
        // in order to reference the IBOutlets. That's why I declared the IBOutlets here
        // and had to update the View here as well.
